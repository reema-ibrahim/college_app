Our website is a multi-use product that ranks the correct colleges to the student. The students (the users) input their desired, acceptance rate, location, ACT, major, undergraduate enrollment, cost, and customize their importance based on their preference, and from a 60-school college database, our algorithm will rank the schools from most compatible with the user’s choices to least. It’s like a BuzzFeed quiz, but for colleges. Products like “US News and Reports” and Niche are a “one size fits all” model so all students are given the same rank of colleges that suit them when in reality they don’t. Our product is different. We not only ask students some of their preferences in a college like “US News and Reports” and Niche but ask them how much their preferences weigh in their college choice. For example, if cost is very important to a user they can tell our algorithm, this in the form they fill out, so that the colleges that are expensive will not be a part of the most compatible school list. We designed our algorithm for the user to be in control. The user can customize our algorithm by putting more weight on criteria important to them, which other products fail to do.
